- **Emergency CSS Debugging** with nuclear-level specificity
- **VS Code Custom Settings** for Tailwind support

## Key AI Prompts & Problem Solving
- "Create a stunning landing page for 'ADmyBRAND AI Suite' with 2025 design trends."
- "Fix invisible CTA buttons using maximum specificity and !important."
- "Debug why my buttons are invisible: check CSS, React, layout, Tailwind, build, and DOM."
- "Make the pricing calculator update per-user price based on monthly/yearly toggle."
- "Reduce unnecessary spacing and fix text cutoff in hero section."
- "Add a debug element to confirm section loads."

## User Collaboration & Contributions
- The user actively participated in debugging, identifying issues with button visibility, and suggesting improvements to color schemes and UI clarity.
- User provided direct feedback, requested removal of debug elements, and helped ensure the final design matched the intended professional look.
- Several manual interventions and suggestions from the user led to a more robust, user-friendly, and visually appealing landing page.

## Portfolio Addition
This project was designed to showcase advanced UI/UX, modern web tech, and deep debugging skills, with strong user-AI collaboration.

## AI-Assisted Workflow (200-300 words)

### AI Tools Used
- **Primary tools:** OpenAI GPT-4 (via Cursor/ChatGPT), Copilot, and VS Code AI extensions
- **Key use cases:**
  - Generating boilerplate for Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript
  - Designing and refactoring reusable UI components (Button, Card, Modal, etc.)
  - Debugging complex CSS issues (invisible buttons, global overrides)
  - Writing and optimizing Tailwind CSS and custom CSS for modern UI/UX
  - Implementing advanced animations (Framer Motion)
  - Creating interactive features (pricing calculator, FAQ, testimonials carousel)
  - Iterative troubleshooting based on user feedback and suggestions

### Sample Prompts
1. "Create a stunning landing page for 'ADmyBRAND AI Suite' with 2025 design trends."
2. "Fix invisible CTA buttons using maximum specificity and !important."
3. "Debug why my buttons are invisible: check CSS, React, layout, Tailwind, build, and DOM."
4. "User suggested color improvements for premium buttons."
5. "Remove debug messages after confirming section loads."

### AI vs Manual Work Split
- **AI-generated:** ~65%
  - Initial project scaffolding, component boilerplate, and most CSS/JSX structure were AI-generated.
  - AI handled most of the debugging, especially for CSS specificity and Tailwind conflicts.
- **Manual/user-driven:** ~35%
  - Manual tweaks for design polish, spacing, and real-world usability.
  - Customizing component props, fixing edge cases, and integrating user feedback and suggestions.
  - User-driven debugging, color scheme suggestions, and UI/UX improvements.
- **Customization:**
  - AI suggestions were iteratively adapted to match the desired visual style and UX, with user feedback driving many refinements.
  - Manual overrides and user collaboration ensured pixel-perfect adjustments, accessibility, and performance.

**Summary:**
The workflow combined rapid AI prototyping with hands-on refinement and active user collaboration. AI accelerated repetitive and boilerplate tasks, while manual coding and user feedback ensured the final product met high standards for design, usability, and business requirements. This hybrid approach resulted in a polished, modern landing page and component library, with deep debugging, real-world problem solving, and strong user-AI teamwork throughout the process.

## AI-Assisted Workflow (200-300 words)

### AI Tools Used
- **Primary tools:** OpenAI GPT-4 (via Cursor/ChatGPT), Copilot, and VS Code AI extensions
- **Key use cases:**
  - Generating boilerplate for Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript
  - Designing and refactoring reusable UI components (Button, Card, Modal, etc.)
  - Debugging complex CSS issues (invisible buttons, global overrides)
  - Writing and optimizing Tailwind CSS and custom CSS for modern UI/UX
  - Implementing advanced animations (Framer Motion)
  - Creating interactive features (pricing calculator, FAQ, testimonials carousel)
  - Iterative troubleshooting based on user feedback

### Sample Prompts
1. "Create a stunning landing page for 'ADmyBRAND AI Suite' with 2025 design trends."
2. "Fix invisible CTA buttons using maximum specificity and !important."
3. "Debug why my buttons are invisible: check CSS, React, layout, Tailwind, build, and DOM."

### AI vs Manual Work Split
- **AI-generated:** ~70%
  - Initial project scaffolding, component boilerplate, and most CSS/JSX structure were AI-generated.
  - AI handled most of the debugging, especially for CSS specificity and Tailwind conflicts.
- **Manual coding:** ~30%
  - Manual tweaks for design polish, spacing, and real-world usability.
  - Customizing component props, fixing edge cases, and integrating user feedback.
- **Customization:**
  - AI suggestions were iteratively adapted to match the desired visual style and UX.
  - Manual overrides were applied for pixel-perfect adjustments, accessibility, and performance.

**Summary:**
The workflow combined rapid AI prototyping with hands-on refinement. AI accelerated repetitive and boilerplate tasks, while manual coding ensured the final product met high standards for design, usability, and business requirements. This hybrid approach resulted in a polished, modern landing page and component library, with deep debugging and real-world problem solving throughout the process.
